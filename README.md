# bestway

Created to training algorithm and have some fun.

The main idea find the best way given a start and end point.

## Build the *map.txt*
We can build the map using a text file, like that:

<pre>
1   1   1   0   2
4   2   6   1   1
1   1   1   0   2
4   3   5   2   9
1   1   1   0   2
</pre>

## HTML result

For above sample, the result will be:  
![Bestway Sample](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carlettibruno/bestway/master/samples/bestway_sample.png)


Doing with bigger map with destionation at x=30 and y=19:  
![Bigger Bestway Sample](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carlettibruno/bestway/master/samples/bigger_bestway_sample.png)

### HTML color legend:
**Green:** Destination   
**Blue:** "Normal traffic" or "Normal factor  
**Orange:** "Moderate traffic" or "Moderate factor"  
**Red:** "Heavy traffic" or "Heavy factor""

## The project can be used for
- to make some games that using this idea.
- to solve some real problem, given a start point, what is best way, with less or more factor envolved.
- and many other things that you can imagine for this algorithm
